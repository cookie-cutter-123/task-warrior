Please keep in mind that I did not use Python for years.
I wanted to show the way how can a project like this be structured and to write some of the scenarios to test the application.

Some of the things that I would do if I had more time:  
- Check all commands from `task help` and write tests for all of them.
- Write the tests for different combination of arguments passed to the task CLI.
- Write negative tests cases, e.g. non-existing arguments, IDs, etc.
- Later on: performance and penetration tests.
